### About BookShare

BookShare is an Android application to borrow and lend books. This is especially useful for college students who can borrow textbooks or reference books for the semester, and then return it. It is possible to set a time limit for borrowing and there is a points system to enable a balance in borrowing and lending for an individual.



### Features

### Motivation

This application has been built as an academic project for an Android development course. It is often seen that textbooks bought for school or college are seldom used after the year is done. This application aims to reduce this problem of books being used only once by letting students share their textbooks and reference books with others on a limited time basis.
